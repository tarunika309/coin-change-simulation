Coin Change Simulation using Greedy Algorithm
Overview
The Coin Change Simulation demonstrates how the Greedy Algorithm efficiently selects the minimum number of coins to make a given amount. This approach works optimally for certain denominations but may fail for others, highlighting the limitations of the greedy method.

Features
✔ Fast & Efficient: Uses a greedy approach to minimize the number of coins.
✔ Interactive Simulation: Allows users to input an amount and receive the optimal coin combination.
✔ Customizable Denominations: Supports different currency systems for testing.
✔ Performance Metrics: Displays the time complexity and efficiency of the algorithm.

How It Works
Sort the coins in descending order.
Pick the largest coin that fits into the remaining amount.
Subtract its value from the remaining amount.
Repeat until the amount becomes zero.
Example:
Given coins {1, 5, 10, 25} and an amount of 30, the greedy algorithm selects:

25 (remaining: 5)
5 (remaining: 0)
Total coins used: 2

Advantages of the Greedy Approach
✅ Fast Execution: Runs in linear or near-linear time.
✅ Easy to Implement: Requires only basic sorting and iteration.
✅ Optimized for Certain Cases: Works perfectly when the coin denominations follow a canonical system (e.g., U.S. currency).

Uniqueness of This Simulation
🔹 Real-Time Calculation – Allows users to test different amounts dynamically.
🔹 Visual Representation – (Optional: If a GUI is implemented, displays results graphically).
🔹 Comparative Analysis – (Optional: Can compare Greedy with Dynamic Programming for edge cases).

Use Cases
🟢 Banking & ATMs: Optimizing cash dispensing systems.
🟢 Vending Machines: Ensuring minimal coin usage.
🟢 Gaming & Virtual Currencies: In-game currency exchange simulations.
🟢 E-commerce & Cash Transactions: Faster change return calculations.

Scope for Advancement
🚀 Handling Non-Greedy Friendly Cases:

Implement Dynamic Programming (DP) for cases where the greedy approach fails.
Example: Coins {1, 3, 4} for amount 6 (Greedy picks 4+1+1, but the optimal is 3+3).
🚀 Multi-Currency Support:

Expand the simulation to work with different currency systems.
🚀 Optimized Greedy Variations:

Use Machine Learning to predict when Greedy fails and switch to an alternative method.
🚀 Graphical User Interface (GUI):

Create an interactive web-based or app-based tool for users.
